**A toolkit for kinase modeling using physical models and machine learning**

.. TODO: Refine this description

.. note:: |IntroNoteText|

.. |IntroNoteText| replace::
    ``kinomodel`` is highly experimental!
    All aspects of the API are still under development.
    This code has not yet been extensively validated; use at your own risk.

Features
--------
* Automated modeling of kinase:inhibitor complexes using multiple X-ray structures
* Automated molecular simulations and free energy calculations to compute physical properties related to kinase activation, inhibitor selectivity, and drug resistance
* Structure-based featurization of kinase:inhibitor models, trajectories, and free energy calculations
* Machine learning models for predicting kinase:inhibitor affinities
